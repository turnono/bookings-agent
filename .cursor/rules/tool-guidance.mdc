# Tool Guidance and ADK Limitations

## Tool Docstrings
- Every tool in [simulation_guide/tools/](mdc:simulation_guide/tools) must have a clear, concise docstring.
- Docstrings should describe:
  - What the tool does
  - When it should be used
  - Any important context or limitations
- Example (see [character_counter.py](mdc:simulation_guide/tools/character_counter.py)):
  ```python
  def count_characters(message: str) -> int:
      """
      Count the number of characters in a message.
      Use for text analysis or input validation tasks.
      """
  ```

## Agent Instruction Guidance
- In each agent's instruction (see [prompt.py](mdc:simulation_guide/prompt.py)), enumerate available tools and provide guidance on when to use each.
- This helps the LLM select the correct tool during execution.

## ADK Tool Limitations
- Only one built-in tool is allowed per root agent (see [agent.py](mdc:simulation_guide/agent.py)).
- Built-in tools cannot be used in sub-agents (see [sub_agents/](mdc:simulation_guide/sub_agents)).
- Custom tools can be used in both root and sub-agents.
- For more, see the limitations described in the project documentation and [README.md](mdc:README.md).
