# Project Structure and Navigation Guide

This project is a Python-based appointment booking agent system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Vertex AI. The main entry point is [main.py](mdc:main.py), which launches a FastAPI server and loads the agent system.

## Key Directories and Files
- [main.py](mdc:main.py): Main entry point for the FastAPI app and agent API.
- [bookings_agent/](mdc:bookings_agent): Core ADK agent package, including agent definitions, tools, prompts, and sub-agents.
  - [agent.py](mdc:bookings_agent/agent.py): Defines the root booking guide agent and its configuration.
  - [prompt.py](mdc:bookings_agent/prompt.py): Contains the main agent instruction and prompt logic.
  - [models.py](mdc:bookings_agent/models.py): Model configuration and selection.
  - [tools/](mdc:bookings_agent/tools): Custom tools for appointment booking and calendar management.
  - [sub_agents/](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents): Contains the booking validator sub-agent for validating appointment requests.
- [deployment/](mdc:deployment): Scripts for local and remote deployment ([local.py](mdc:deployment/local.py), [remote.py](mdc:deployment/remote.py), [cleanup.py](mdc:deployment/cleanup.py)).
- [README.md](mdc:README.md): Project overview, setup, and usage instructions.

## How to Navigate
- Start with [main.py](mdc:main.py) to see how the FastAPI app and agent are initialized.
- Explore [bookings_agent/agent.py](mdc:bookings_agent/agent.py) for the root booking guide agent configuration.
- Refer to [bookings_agent/prompt.py](mdc:bookings_agent/prompt.py) for the main agent's instruction set.
- Check [bookings_agent/tools/](mdc:bookings_agent/tools) for available calendar and validation tools.
- See [bookings_agent/sub_agents/booking_validator/](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents/booking_validator) for the validator sub-agent that helps screen appointment requests.
- See [deployment/](mdc:deployment) for deployment and session management scripts.
