# Agent Architecture and Tooling

## Root Agent
- Defined in [bookings_agent/agent.py](mdc:bookings_agent/agent.py) as `root_agent`.
- Uses the instruction from [prompt.py](mdc:bookings_agent/prompt.py) and the default model from [models.py](mdc:bookings_agent/models.py).
- Has access to custom tools (e.g., `count_characters` from [tools/character_counter.py](mdc:bookings_agent/tools/character_counter.py)).
- Delegates specialized tasks to sub-agents.

## Sub-Agents
- Located in [bookings_agent/sub_agents/](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents):
  - **TaskMaster Franklin Covey** ([taskmaster_franklin_covey/agent.py](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents/taskmaster_franklin_covey/agent.py))
    - Specializes in task breakdown, prioritization, and productivity frameworks.
    - Uses instruction from [prompts.py](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents/taskmaster_franklin_covey/prompts.py).
  - **Architect James Brown** ([architect_james_brown/agent.py](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents/architect_james_brown/agent.py))
    - Specializes in technical architecture and blueprint design for agents.
    - Uses instruction from [prompts.py](mdc:bookings_agent/sub_agents/architect_james_brown/prompts.py).

## Tool Usage and Limitations
- Tools are defined in [bookings_agent/tools/](mdc:bookings_agent/tools) and exposed via [tools/__init__.py](mdc:bookings_agent/tools/__init__.py).
- Each tool should have a clear docstring describing its purpose and usage.
- **ADK Limitation:** Only one built-in tool can be used per root agent; built-in tools cannot be used in sub-agents. Custom tools can be used freely.
- Tool guidance and differentiation should be provided in agent instructions and tool docstrings for best LLM performance.
