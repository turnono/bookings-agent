# Deployment and Usage Guide

## Current Deployment Method
- Deployment is currently performed using the [makefile](mdc:makefile), which deploys the service to Google Cloud Run.
- The [deployment/](mdc:deployment) folder and its scripts are **not currently used**.

## Agent Engine (Vertex) Scripts (Not in Use)
- [deployment/local.py](mdc:deployment/local.py), [deployment/remote.py](mdc:deployment/remote.py), and [deployment/cleanup.py](mdc:deployment/cleanup.py) are for deploying and managing the agent on Vertex AI Agent Engine.
- These scripts are provided for reference but are not part of the active deployment workflow.

## Environment Setup
- Ensure `.env` is configured with Google Cloud project, location, and bucket if you plan to use Vertex AI in the future.
- For Cloud Run deployment, follow the instructions in the [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [makefile](mdc:makefile).
