# Bookings Agent

Bookings Agent is an intelligent, modular system for managing appointment bookings, user screening, and calendar protectionâ€”designed for seamless integration with social media and modern web interfaces.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to automate and streamline the process of booking appointments, especially for users coming from social media platforms. It ensures only relevant, serious inquiries are allowed through, protects the owner's private time, and provides a professional, guided experience from first contact to confirmed booking.
